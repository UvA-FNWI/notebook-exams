# FNWI notebook exams ToC

We created two ways of serving notebooks: using local machines and in the cloud, and two ways of rendering notebooks ready for exams: using `nbgrader` and using a homecooked system. Code and information on these setups is found in this repository.

1. Serving notebooks
	1. Locally at the IWO machines.
    		* For documentation on how to use Anaconda in digital exam rooms, refer to `notebook-exams/Docs/Anaconda_notebooks_in_digital_exam_rooms.md`
    		* For documentation on how to use nbgrader, refer to `notebook-exams/Using_notebooks_for_exams/Using_nbgrader/nbgrader_workflow.ipynb`
	2. In the cloud using Jupyterhub, Docker and Google

2. Using notebooks for exams
	1. Using `nbgrader`
	2. Using FNWI `questions` module.
