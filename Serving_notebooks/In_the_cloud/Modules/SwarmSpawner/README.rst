**SwarmSpawner** enables `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ to spawn single user notebook servers in Docker Services.

More info about Docker Services `here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/>`_.


Prerequisites
================

Python version 3.3 and above is required.


Installation
================

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install swarmspawner

Installation from GitHub
============================

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/cassinyio/SwarmSpawner
   cd SwarmSpawner
   python setup.py install

Configuration
================

You can find an example jupyter_config.py inside `examples <examples>`_.

The spawner
================
Docker Engine in Swarm mode and the related services work in a different way compared to Docker containers.

Tell JupyterHub to use SwarmSpawner by adding the following lines to your `jupyterhub_config.py`:

.. code-block:: python

        c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'cassinyspawner.SwarmSpawner'
        c.JupyterHub.hub_ip = '0.0.0.0'
        # This should be the name of the jupyterhub service
        c.SwarmSpawner.jupyterhub_service_name = 'NameOfTheService'

What is ``jupyterhub_service_name``?

Inside a Docker engine in Swarm mode the services use a `name` instead of a `ip` to communicate with each other.
'jupyterhub_service_name' is the name of ther service for the JupyterHub.

Networks
============
It's important to put the JupyterHub service (also the proxy) and the services that are running jupyter notebook inside the same network, otherwise they couldn't reach each other.
SwarmSpawner use the service's name instead of the service's ip, as a consequence JupyterHub and servers should share the same overlay network (network across nodes).

.. code-block:: python

        #list of networks
        c.SwarmSpawner.networks = ["mynetwork"]


Define the services inside jupyterhub_config.py
===============================================
You can define *container_spec*, *resource_spec* and *networks* inside **jupyterhub_config.py**.

Container_spec__
-------------------
__ https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docs/user_guides/swarm_services.md


``command`` and ``args`` depends on the image that you are using.

If you use one of the images from the Jupyter docker-stack you need to specify ``args`` as: ``/usr/local/bin/start-singleuser.sh``

If you are using a specific image, well it's up to you to specify the right command.

.. code-block:: python

    c.SwarmSpawner.container_spec = {
                  # The command to run inside the service
                  # 'args' : ['/usr/local/bin/start-singleuser.sh'], # (list)
                  'Image' : 'YourImage',
                  'mounts' : mounts
          }


**Note:** in a container spec, ``args`` sets the equivalent of CMD in the Dockerfile, ``command`` sets the equivalent of ENTRYPOINT.
The notebook server command should not be the ENTRYPOINT, so generally use ``args``, not ``command``, to specify how to launch the notebook server.

See this `issue <https://github.com/cassinyio/SwarmSpawner/issues/6>`_  for more info.

Bind a Host dir
---------------------
With ``'type':'bind'`` you mount a local directory of the host inside the container.

*Remember that source should exist in the node where you are creating the service.*

.. code-block:: python

        notebook_dir = os.environ.get('NOTEBOOK_DIR') or '/home/jovyan/work'
        c.SwarmSpawner.notebook_dir = notebook_dir

.. code-block:: python

        mounts = [{'type' : 'bind',
                'source' : 'MountPointOnTheHost',
                'target' : 'MountPointInsideTheContainer',}]


Mount a named volume
----------------------
With ``'type':'volume'`` you mount a Docker Volume inside the container.
If the volume doesn't exist it will be created.

.. code-block:: python

        mounts = [{'type' : 'volume',
                'source' : 'NameOfTheVolume',
                'target' : 'MountPointInsideTheContainer',}]


Named path
--------------
For both types, volume and bind, you can specify a ``{username}`` inside the source:

.. code-block:: python

        mounts = [{'type' : 'volume',
                'source' : 'jupyterhub-user-{username}',
                'target' : 'MountPointInsideTheContainer',}]


username will be the hashed version of the username.


Mount an anonymous volume
-------------------------
**This kind of volume will be removed with the service.**

.. code-block:: python

        mounts = [{'type' : 'volume',
                'target' : 'MountPointInsideTheContainer',}]


Resource_spec
---------------

You can also specify some resource for each service

.. code-block:: python

        c.SwarmSpawner.resource_spec = {
                        'cpu_limit' : 1000, # (int) – CPU limit in units of 10^9 CPU shares.
                        'mem_limit' : int(512 * 1e6), # (int) – Memory limit in Bytes.
                        'cpu_reservation' : 1000, # (int) – CPU reservation in units of 10^9 CPU shares.
                        'mem_reservation' : int(512 * 1e6), # (int) – Memory reservation in Bytes
                        }

Using user_options
--------------------

There is the possibility to set parameters using ``user_options``

.. code-block:: python

        # To use user_options in service creation
        c.SwarmSpawner.use_user_options = False


To control the creation of the services you have 2 ways, using **jupyterhub_config.py** or **user_options**.

Remember that at the end you are just using the `Docker Engine API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/>`_.

**user_options, if used, will overwrite jupyter_config.py for services.**

If you set ``c.SwarmSpawner.use_user_option = True`` the spawner will use the dict passed through the form or as json body when using the Hub Api.

The spawner expect a dict with these keys:

.. code-block:: python

        user_options = {
                'container_spec' : {
                        # (string or list) command to run in the image.
                        'args' : ['/usr/local/bin/start-singleuser.sh'],
                        # name of the image
                        'Image' : '',
                        'mounts' : mounts,
                        'resource_spec' : {
                                # (int) – CPU limit in units of 10^9 CPU shares.
                                'cpu_limit': int(1 * 1e9),
                                # (int) – Memory limit in Bytes.
                                'mem_limit': int(512 * 1e6),
                                # (int) – CPU reservation in units of 10^9 CPU shares.
                                'cpu_reservation': int(1 * 1e9),
                                # (int) – Memory reservation in bytes
                                'mem_reservation': int(512 * 1e6),
                                },
                        # list of constrains
                        'placement' : [],
                        # list of networks
                        'network' : [],
                        # name of service
                        'name' : ''
                        }
                }


Names of the Jupyter notebook service inside Docker engine in Swarm mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When JupyterHub spawns a new Jupyter notebook server the name of the service will be ``{service_prefix}-{service_owner}-{service_suffix}``

You can change the service_prefix in this way:

Prefix of the service in Docker

.. code-block:: python

        c.SwarmSpawner.service_prefix = "jupyterhub"


``service_owner`` is the hexdigest() of the hashed ``user.name``.

In case of named servers (more than one server for user) ``service_suffix`` is the name of the server, otherwise is always 1.

Downloading images
-------------------
Docker Engine in Swarm mode downloads images automatically from the repository.
Either the image is available on the remote repository or locally, if not you will get an error.

Because before starting the service you have to complete the download of the image is better to have a longer timeout (default is 30 secs)

.. code-block:: python

        c.SwarmSpawner.start_timeout = 60 * 5


You can use all the docker images inside the `Jupyter docker-stacks`_.
